# Calculating arithmetic expressions (before migration to python)

## About

This repository contains Java code for computing arithmetic expressions. It is deliberately incomplete as it serves to be the basis of all kinds of extensions, such as a more sophisticated Calculator application. The code was written to be used for educational purposes at the University of Mons, Belgium in the context of the software evolution course.


### Unit testing and BDD

*  All tests can be found in the src\test directory. They serve as executable documentation of the source code.
*  The source code is accompanied by a set of JUnit 5 unit tests. These tests can be written and run in the usual way. If you are not familiar with unit testing or JUnit 5, please refer to https://junit.org/junit5/.
*  The source code is accompanied by a set of Cucumber BDD scenarios, also running in Junit. If you are not familiar with Cucumber and BDD, please refer to https://cucumber.io/docs/cucumber/.
The BDD scenarios are specified as .feature files in the src\test\resources directory. Some classes defined in src\test take care of converting these scenarios to executable JUnit tests.

### Prerequisites

*  You will need to have a running version of Java 23 on your machine in order to be able to compile and execute this code, although it is also backward compatible with earlier versions of Java.
*  You will need to have a running version of Maven, since this project is accompanied by a pom.xml file so that it can be installed, compiled, tested and run using Maven.

### Installation and testing instructions

*  Upon first use of the code in this repository, you will need to run "mvn clean install" to ensure that all required project dependencies (e.g. for Java, JUnit, Cucumber, and Maven) will be downloaded and installed locally.
*  Assuming you have a sufficiently recent version of Maven installed (the required versions are specified as properties in the POM file), you can compile the source code using "mvn compile"
*  Once the code is compiled, you can execute the main class of the Java code using "mvn exec:java" 
*  The tests and BDD scenarios are executable with Maven using "mvn test"
*  Note that the tests are also executed when you do a "mvn install". It is possible to skip those tests by providing an extra parameter. For details of more advanced uses of Maven, please refer to its official documentation https://maven.apache.org/guides/.

### Test coverage and JavaDoc reporting

*  In addition to testing the code, "mvn test" will also generate a test coverage report (in HTML format) using JaCoCo. This test coverage is generated in target/site/jacoco.
*  When packaging the code using "mvn package" the JavaDoc code documentation will be generated and stored in target/site/apidocs.

## Built With

*  [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) - an open source build automation and dependency management tool
*  [JUnit5](https://junit.org/junit5/) - a unit testing framework for Java
*  [Cucumber](https://cucumber.io/docs/cucumber/) - a tool for Behaviour-Driven Development
*  [JaCoCo](https://www.jacoco.org) - a code coverage library for Java
*  [JavaDoc](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/javadoc/javadoc.html) - a code documentation tool for Java

# Calculating arithmetic expressions (Python)

## About

This repository contains Java code for computing arithmetic expressions. It is deliberately incomplete as it serves to be the basis of all kinds of extensions, such as a more sophisticated Calculator application. The code was written to be used for educational purposes at the University of Mons, Belgium in the context of the software evolution course.

### Unit testing and BDD

*  All tests can be found in the src\test\python directory. They serve as executable documentation of the source code.
*  The source code is accompanied by a set of unittest unit tests. These tests can be written and run in the usual way. If you are not familiar with unit testing , please refer to https://docs.python.org/fr/3/library/unittest.html#.
*  The source code is accompanied by a set of Behave BDD scenarios. If you are not familiar with Behave and BDD, please refer to https://behave.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html#.
The BDD scenarios are specified as .feature files in the src\test\python\features directory. Some classes defined in src\test\python\features\steps take care of converting these scenarios to executable tests.

* Test report website : https://oz-noxiii.github.io/calculator-cucumber-2025/

### Prerequisites

*  You will need to have a running version of python 3 on your machine in order to be able to execute this code.
*  You will need to have a running version of pip and make, since this project is accompanied by a Makefile file so that it can be installed, compiled, tested and run using make.
*  You will need to have a running version of allure, since behave does not generate html reports by default. (https://github.com/allure-framework/allure2)

### Installation and testing instructions

#### In a venv

* Upon first use of the code in this repository in your virtual environment, you will need to run "mvn clean install" to ensure that all required project dependencies (e.g. for python, unittest, behave, and make) will be downloaded and installed locally. 
* The tests and BDD scenarios are executable with Maven using "make test"
* You can execute the main of the Python code using "make run" 


#### Without your venv

*  Upon first use of the code in this repository, you will need to run "make venv-clean venv-install" to ensure that all required project dependencies (e.g. for python, unittest, behave, allure, and make) will be downloaded and installed locally.
*  The tests and BDD scenarios are executable with Maven using "make venv-test"
*  You can execute the main of the Python code using "make venv-run" 

### Test coverage and Doc reporting (not entirely implemented)

*  In addition to testing the code, "make test" will also generate a test coverage report (in HTML format) using coverage. This test coverage is generated in htmlcov.
